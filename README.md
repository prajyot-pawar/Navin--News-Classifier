Navin is a Flutter app that gets news from a news API and classifies news with the help of machine learning. The app allows users to stay up-to-date on the latest news, filter news by category, and search for news articles. NAvin also uses machine learning to classify news articles into different categories, such as "business," "technology," "politics," and "entertainment." This allows users to easily find the news that is most relevant to them.
